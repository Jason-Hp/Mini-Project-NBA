# SC1015-Mini-Project-NBA
A mini project for SC1015 Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. We wanted to see if the regular season information can predict NBA champion.
Hence, we decided to analyse the past few season regular season data below.

## Problem Definition
- Which variables from the regular season have a relationship with whether the team becomes/is a NBA Champion?
- Is there a change in a team's playstyle over the seasons?
- Can we use Machine Learning techniques to predict NBA Champion using regular season data?

## Brief Details Of Notebook
1. Data preperation & cleaning
   - Fill in all NULL values
   - One-hot encode a few categorical variables
   - Feature Engineering?
   - Remove insignificant columns (variables)
   - Standardize decimal places & team names
2. Visualization & Exploratory Data Analysis
   - Box-plots, Swarm-plots & Violin-plots
   - Point-Biserial Correlation Coefficient & P-value
   - Paired vertical column plots
   - Confusion Matrix (Heat Map)
   - Time-series plot
   - Cramer's V, phi coefficient & P-value
3. Machine Learning
   - Multi-variate Classification Tree
     - Best 10 variables (Predictors)
     - Average Classification Accuracy: 0.91
     - True Postivie Rate: 0.40
     - True Negative Rate: 0.94
